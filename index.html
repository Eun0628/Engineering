        Week 2: 08/29/22 - 09/02/22<br>
        This is my first blog.<br>
        This week we worked on brainstorming our Rube Goldberg Machines this week.<br>
        Another thing we did was we learned about the different machines like pulleys, levers, inclined slopes, etc.<br>
        We also started Tinkercad to create 3D models of our brainstormed ideas.<br>
        It was enjoyable to make the model and I even made a model of my earbuds for our challenge.<br>
        It's fun to make models and see the things you envision come to life.<br>
        Another thing we did this week is learn how to code html and how to create these blogs for our website.<br>
        Some of the things we learned how to do with html include: headings, line breaks, horizontal rules, images, page links, and more.<br>
        Included below are some photos of my earbud model for the challenge.<br>

        Week 3: 09/05/22 - 09/09/22<br>
        This week we finalized our Rube Goldberg Machines on Tinkercad and chose which ones we were going to build in our groups.<br>
        We had to make sure all the measurements and details were accurate on our models.<br>
        We also had a challenge to accurately recreate an 'E' that our partner designed.<br>
        The challenge went smoothly for the most part but the 'E' that my partner designed had a couple of flaws.<br>
        The measurements weren't accurate so the lines for the 'E' didn't touch at the top.<br>
        Although there were a couple of mistakes in the design, it still tured out well.<br>

        Week 4: 09/12/22 - 09/16/22<br>
        This week we started building our Rube Goldberg Machines.<br>
        My group decided to use Ben's model for our project.<br>
        We finished building our model and started testing the model.<br>
        Our first test was successful but we have yet to try it with a ballon and needle attached.<br>

        Another thing we did this week was our week 4 challenge.<br>
        For this challenge we made paper boats and tested them with weights in water to see which ones would last the longest.<br>
        I was part of group 8 and our boat was able to last for the full five minutes.<br>
        Unfortunately, the boat didn't have enough weight on it so we weren't able to win.<br>
        We learned that the more surface tension the boat has, the longer it would last.<br>

        Week 5: 09/19/22 - 09/23/22<br>
        This week we made the finishing touches on our Rube Goldberg Machines.<br>
        We also officially started testing our machines with the baseball, needle, and balloon.<br>
        Our machine failed the first test but was successful the second attempt with no changes.<br>
        I think it might have failed the first time because the balloon wasn't aligned corretly with the needle.<br>
        We were also able to see the other engineering classes projects.<br>
        Surprisingly, their models were extremely different from ours.<br>
        Their machines were more complicated and used more resources than ours did.<br>
        It was interesting to see the difference in our machines.<br>

         Week 6: 09/26/22 - 09/30/22<br>
         This week we worked on our Laptop Dissection Project.<br>
         We got an old chromebook and disassembled it using a screwdriver.<br>
         There were many steps to follow and some steps were a bit difficult to do correctly.<br>
         But overall it was pretty enjoyable and fun to do.<br>
         It was cool being able to see the inside of computers and how each component works together.<br>
         After we disassembled the chromebook, we identified all the components in the chromebook and how they fit together.<br>
         Then, after we finished that we had to reassemble the computer.<br>
         I think that reassembling it was harder than taking it apart but we still managed to do it.<br>
