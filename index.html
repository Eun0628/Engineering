        This is my first blog.<br>
        This week we worked on brainstorming our Rube Goldberg Machines this week.<br>
        Another thing we did was we learned about the different machines like pulleys, levers, inclined slopes, etc.<br>
        We also started Tinkercad to create 3D models of our brainstormed ideas.<br>
        It was enjoyable to make the model and I even made a model of my earbuds for our challenge.<br>
        It's fun to make models and see the things you envision come to life.<br>
        Another thing we did this week is learn how to code html and how to create these blogs for our website.<br>
        Some of the things we learned how to do with html include: headings, line breaks, horizontal rules, images, page links, and more.<br>
        Included below are some photos of my earbud model for the challenge.<br>
